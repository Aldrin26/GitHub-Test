	<dt>Attachment</dt>
		<dd>is a document sent with an email message. Many types of files can be sent this way (e.g. Word documents, PDFs, Excel files, JPEGs).

If you have a large file, it is considered good practice to compress the file using software such as Winzip before attaching it.</dd>

	<dt>Cache</dt>

The next time you want that page, instead of requesting the file from the web server, your web browser just accesses it from the cache, so the page loads quickly. The downside to this is that if the cached web page is often updated, you may miss the latest version.
